Chatbot for Individual Assignment

Implementation of API's:

The current version of the Chatbot has been improved using API's. The API's used were Wikipedia and Google Translate, the use of these API's has allowed the Chatbot conversations to be more useful as well as add more value to the user. The implementation of these API's involved the addition of new Maven dependencies, new functions as well as new methods to extract data to give the API's.
